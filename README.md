# Portfolio-Jose-Alberto-Salazar-ICT---NMSU
This portfolio reflects my comprehensive education and hands-on experience in Information and Communication Technology (ICT), gained through a series of advanced courses at New Mexico State University (NMSU).
 My coursework has equipped me with a strong foundation in networking, system administration, cybersecurity, web development, and enterprise IT management, preparing me for roles in IT infrastructure, cybersecurity, and software development.

Key Areas of Expertise:
Networking and Infrastructure:

Designed and configured complex network topologies using VLANs, trunking, and routing protocols like RIPv2, EIGRP, and OSPF.

Analyzed network traffic with Wireshark to optimize performance and troubleshoot issues.

Automated network administration tasks using Ansible and managed containerized environments with Docker and Docker Swarm.

System Administration:

Administered Windows Server environments, including Active Directory, Group Policy, and PowerShell scripting.

Managed Linux systems, including user permissions, network configuration, and security hardening with tools like SELinux and Lynis.

Automated system deployments using Vagrant and VirtualBox.

Cybersecurity and Ethical Hacking:

Conducted penetration testing using tools like Metasploit, Nmap, and Nessus to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.

Simulated social engineering attacks with the Social Engineering Toolkit (SET) and analyzed web application vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.

Secured systems through firewall configuration, access control lists (ACLs), and encryption techniques.

Web Development and Applications:

Developed dynamic web applications using HTML5, CSS3, PHP, and MySQL, and integrated RESTful APIs.

Created multimedia content for web applications using tools like Audacity, Gimp, and Blender.

Deployed and optimized web applications on platforms like Heroku and Netlify.

Enterprise IT Management:

Automated enterprise network administration tasks using Ansible and managed version control with GitHub and Gitea.

Configured and managed Docker containers and orchestrated multi-container applications with Docker Swarm.

Implemented route redistribution and optimized network performance in enterprise environments.

Technical Skills:
Networking: VLANs, trunking, RIPv2, EIGRP, OSPF, Wireshark, Ansible.

System Administration: Windows Server, Active Directory, Linux, PowerShell, Bash scripting, SELinux.
